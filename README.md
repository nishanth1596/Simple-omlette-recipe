# Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page Solution

This is my solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). The challenge allowed me to focus on building a recipe page layout that is designed **specifically for desktop**. The goal was to structure and style a recipe page using HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on a **desktop-first** approach.

## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML5**: Used semantic elements to structure the page.
- **CSS3**: Styled the page with a focus on desktop design.
- **Custom Properties**: Implemented custom properties for colors and fonts.
- **Flexbox**: Used Flexbox to create a flexible layout.
- **Desktop-First Design**: The layout and styling were designed primarily for larger screens.

### What I Learned

- **Flexbox**: Deepened my understanding of using Flexbox to create responsive layouts. Even though the page is desktop-first, Flexbox helped create a more flexible and modern layout.
- **CSS Layout Techniques**: Worked with different CSS properties like margin, padding, and alignment to achieve a neat and well-spaced design.
- **Semantic HTML**: Used semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, and `<table>` to ensure clear structure and accessibility.

### Continued Development

- **Optimizing for Mobile**: While the page was designed for desktop, I plan to experiment with adding basic media queries for mobile responsiveness in the future.
- **Improving Accessibility**: The next step will be to improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels and enhancing the navigation for screen readers.
- **Adding JavaScript Interactivity**: I would also like to add some JavaScript functionality, such as a cooking timer or user-generated recipe submission forms.

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my understanding of layout techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid to create more complex and responsive designs.
